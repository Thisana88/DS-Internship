# Mean Reversion Trading strategies for cryptocurrency Data

## Description

This Jupyter Notebook project explores mean reversion trading strategies using cryptocurrency data, specifically Bitcoin (BTC) and Avalanche (AVAX). It includes data preparation, cleaning, statistical analysis, and implementation of trading strategies. The project aims to provide insights into mean reversion principles and their application in financial markets.

## Contents

Data Preparation: Retrieve cryptocurrency data using Yahoo Finance API and preprocess it for analysis.
Data Cleaning: Check for missing values, outliers, and data types, and handle them accordingly.
Statistical Analysis: Analyze price trends, correlations, and stationarity using visualizations and statistical tests.
Mean Reversion: Implement mean reversion trading strategies based on Z-scores and moving averages.

## Results

The project provides insights into the effectiveness of mean reversion strategies and compares different trading approaches. Key findings include correlations between cryptocurrency prices and the mean reversion signals.

## Conclusion

Mean reversion strategies offer potential opportunities for profit in financial markets, but their success depends on various factors such as market conditions, asset selection, and risk management. Further experimentation and validation are recommended before deploying these strategies in live trading environments.
